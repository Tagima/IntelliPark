## IntelliPark: WSN for Smart Parking

This project was done as part of the course Networked Embedded Systems at TU Eindhoven.

Parking of bicycles has been a serious concern across the Netherlands.
Most of the time empty spots are not found and bicycles are parked in a random manner. The objective of this project is to design an intelligent parking mechanism which enables us to identify empty parking spots and solve the issue of parking.

This repository contains the code used in the project.
